	sim: send() should NOT use the transmissionId already on the packet, ever

	It must now be explicitly specified in SendOptions for the original
	packet and for updates, too.

2020-10-13  Rudolf Hornig

	test: fixed test failure caused by changed error message in libXML
	library

2020-10-12  Andras Varga

	test: follow rename in the rest of the tests

2020-10-11  Andras Varga

	sim: transmission updates API: origPacketId renamed to transmissionId

	related changes:
	- isUpdate() now uses separate flag
	- for the original packets, transmissionId is implicitly taken from the
	message ID

2020-10-12  Andras Varga

	test: tests updated for recent changes

	for cSimpleModule_sendOptions_2.test, note: duration/remainingDuration
	specified in SendOptions now OVERRIDE the duration computed from the
	channel data rate.

2020-09-11  Andras Varga

	sim: cModule: deleteModule() refactoring

	It is not supposed to do stuff (like fire pre-model-change notifications)
	from a halfway-deleted module. Now we do every risky thing (such as
	deleting submodules and disconnecting gates) from doDeleteModule(), and
	only delete the module object when it is already barebones (no
	submodules, gates, listeners, etc).

	The deletion sequence is now pretty much the reverse of the setup
	sequence.

	sim: cIListener destructor to unsubscribe from all places

	... instead of insisting on being already unsubscribed.

	This fixes the issue introduced in the previous commit.

2020-08-14  Andras Varga

	sim: cModule: change module destruction sequence

	So that when deleting a compound module, the compound module's local
	listeners are notified about the deletion of the submodules.

	The downside is that more listeners now need to be explicitly
	unsubscribed
	(listeners MUST NOT be subscribed anywhere when they are destructed,
	cIListener's destructor contains an assertion for that). Due to this
	change, signals_modelchange_1.test currently breaks (error during network
	teardown).

2020-08-13  Andras Varga

	sim: fix bug introduced a few commits earlier

	"added demux filter" commit broke Register_ResultFilter() and
	Register_ResultRecorder() when class had namespace.

2020-08-06  TÖRÖK Attila

	test/anim: Add a multisend test to check for the fix of the message
	picking bug

2020-08-10  Andras Varga

	sim: added DemuxFilter, see test for usage

	Needed changes:
	- cResultListener: clone() method added
	- Register_ResultRecorder() impl changed to allow creating
	filters/recorders
	 with createOne(); this is needed by clone()
	- cResultFilter: init() to store component and attrsProperty, because
	 clone() needs them
	- cResultListener: receiveSignal() methods need to be public so that
	 DemuxFilter can call them.
	- cResultRecorder: added setDemuxLabel(), needed as part of result names

2020-07-29  Andras Varga

	test/core: new tests for SendOptions and tx updates

	- cSimpleModule_sendOptions_3.test -- for sendDirect()

	- cGate_deliverImmediately_2.test -- to test that updates are collapsed
	 if deliverImmediately=false is set on gate

	- cSimpleModule_sendOptions_2.test: added test for disabling channel
	 mid-transmission

2020-07-29  Andras Varga

	test/core: eventlogrecording_1.test: added tx update calls, updated
	result

	Changes in the eventlog:
	- two extra timers created at the top
	- two extra events with sending with tx update
	- plus event numbers and message/packet IDs were shifted due to extra
	events/messages

2020-07-29  Andras Varga

	test/core: eventlogrecording_1.test: adding tx update stuff, step 1:
	added extra code as inactive

	Result is updated for msgkind enum and timing changes.

2020-07-27  Andras Varga

	test/core: two new tests for SendOptions

2020-07-28  Andras Varga

	test/core: follow change: "send()/sendDelayed()" prefix was dropped from
	error message

	for simpler (and marginally more efficient) code

2020-07-28  Andras Varga

	test/common: follow change: in DatarateChannel, datarate=0 no longer
	means "infinite" (i.e. zero tx time)

2020-07-28  Andras Varga

	test/core,etc: follow cChannel::processMessage() signature change

	plus: eliminate warning in eventlogrecording_1.test

2020-07-27  Andras Varga

	test/core: follow changes on setDeliverOnReceptionStart() and
	forceTransmissionFinishTime()

	- setDeliverOnReceptionStart() --> setDeliverImmediately()
	- forceTransmissionFinishTime() was removed

2020-07-16  Andras Varga

	sim: cStatisticBuilder: add possibility to disable auto-adding the warmup
	filter

	This opens the possiblity for the user to add them in the way
	appropriate. E.g. cf.   min(warmup(foo)) [this is the default] and
	warmup(min(foo))
	[which might occasionally be what the user wants instead]

2020-07-17  Andras Varga

	samples, tests: updated for changed getModuleByPath() behavior

	It can no longer return nullptr.

2020-07-14  Andras Varga

	sim: cComponent: store per-component cSimulation pointers

	... instead of relying on getActiveSimulation()

	Also: fix related tests (getSimulation() is not supposed to be called on
	a deleted module, and now it crashes too)

2020-06-22  Andras Varga

	sim: getModuleByPath() made stricter (do not tolerate if module doesn't
	exist); added findModuleByPath()

2020-04-28  Andras Varga

	sim: cModule: allow modules to be deleted (incl self-deletion) and
	created at will during initialization

	Note: new modules are always *appended* to the end of the submodule list,
	which makes things easier.

2020-05-05  Rudolf Hornig

	tests: fixed tests to reflect additional scalars (more scalars from
	histograms and vectors)

2020-04-20  Rudolf Hornig

	ChangeLogs: updated, by editing the raw versions. Guidelines:

	- removed duplications (changes released earlier as version 5.5 and 5.6)
	- removed uninteresting changes (e.g. "typo fixed"), and back-and-forth
	changes
	- describe impact of commit to that specific folder (e.g.
	include/omnetpp/ChangeLog
	 should describe the simkernel API changes, not the feature or bugfix
	which caused
	 the API change)
	- tried to make the descriptions more self-contained, i.e. understandable
	 without looking at the actual file changes

		- Two new test cases for ensuring that infinities are accepted and they do
		not affect the histogram layout.

		- Updated histogram save/load tests for changed file file format.

		- Updated fingerprint of empty histogram test (it was out of date already).

		- Also, fingerprint of SineWeightedLinear yielded two different values on
		two different computers (Attila's laptop and Giga)

	* opp_test.pl: To make it easier to create new test cases from
	existing ones, removed %name from test file syntax; now test name
	is derived from the file name. Cleaned up error handling.
	Changed some command-line switches. Introduced {} as synonym for
	@TESTNAME@. Improved reporting.

	* runtest: accepts command-line args

2002-02-14  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* runtest: Create directory work if it doesn't exist.
