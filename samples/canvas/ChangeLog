	samples: added missing .cproject file to canvas example

2020-01-15  Andras Varga

	ChangeLogs: updated, by editing the raw versions. Guidelines:

	- removed duplications (changes released earlier as version 5.5 and 5.6)
	- removed uninteresting changes (e.g. "typo fixed"), and back-and-forth
	changes
	- describe impact of commit to that specific folder (e.g.
	include/omnetpp/ChangeLog
	 should describe the simkernel API changes, not the feature or bugfix
	which caused
	 the API change)
	- tried to make the descriptions more self-contained, i.e. understandable
	 without looking at the actual file changes
